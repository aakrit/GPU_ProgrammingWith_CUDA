GPU Print Testing Program

This program invokes your GPU to print to STDOUT

Type make to create the exec file
make will use nvcc to compile.
Please make sure you have nvcc installed (nvcc --version)

In the hw.cu (cuda file) the number of threads executing depends on declaration of the cuda function (in this case 'gpu_greeting'). Note that all cuda funcitons have a return type __global__ (instructed by the nvcc compiler as a function running on the GPU)

Recall that this only works on computers with an NVIDIA GPU
